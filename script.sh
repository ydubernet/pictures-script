# It mainly logs them, but if an option is set, it also can perform write operations such as deletes.

# TODO : Choose a license
# TODO : Take into parameter the location of the pictures software so that the user could launch the script from everywhere
# TODO : Permit the user to look for files non recursively
# TODO : Think about deleting input_file as an option to get it as an input of the script
