# This script is set to check in a folder if some pictures given in an input file exist
# if so, the default comportment is to show them on the screen
# The user can param the execution of the script so that instead of showing them on the screen, it deletes them.

# TODO : Solve the space problems so that we could execute this script without renaming all repositories
# TODO : Choose a license
# TODO : Make the grep work for pictures whose name contains dashes
# TODO : Take into parameter the location of the pictures software so that the user could launch the script from everywhere
# TODO : Create input options instead of executing depending on the number of parameters (Unix like)
# TODO : Add an option to choose which extract function will be used (default JPG)
# TODO : Avoid having to input a edite.txt file. Directly ls the content, except given a new option
# TODO : If we do not have an input file, avoid the lookForPictures function call


#Global variables
#The counter variable counts how many operations succeeded.
