# This script is set to check in a folder if some pictures given in an input file exist
# if so, the default comportment is to show them on the screen
# The user can param the execution of the script so that instead of showing them on the screen, it deletes them.

# 18/08/2015 # Adding a function to extract CR2  #
#            # pictures                          #
# 26/08/2015 # Adding an options parser          #
#            # Avoiding call of look_for_pictures#
#            # if we do not have an input file   #
#            # Possible for the user not to have #

#            # Adding an option to choose which  #

# TODO : Take into parameter the location of the pictures software so that the user could launch the script from everywhere
# TODO : Make this script work with a lot of other formats. After all, we do nt necessarly need to work with pictures, given the commands we use in this script.
